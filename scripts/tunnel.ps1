# Keep the Outray tunnel alive. If it drops, this restarts it automatically.
# The fixed subdomain means the public URL is ALWAYS https://hive-ace.outray.app
# so the webhook URL you give WhatsApp / Twilio never changes - even after a restart.
#
# Usage (from repo root):  pwsh ./scripts/tunnel.ps1   (or)  powershell ./scripts/tunnel.ps1
